  "STUDENT": "Student",
  "student_text": "During the internship, the student is given the responsibility to independently manage the feedback loop. On their own initiative, the student will go through this process three times, starting with a self-evaluation. The student reflects on his own performance and records his findings. A self-reflection is then drawn up, delving deeper into the skills learned, challenges and growth points. Finally, the student will write a conclusion in which he integrates the insights from the self-evaluation and self-reflection. This structured approach offers the student the opportunity to proactively manage his development and learn consciously from the experiences during the internship.",
  "MENTOR": "Mentor",
  "mentor_text": "During the internship, the mentor plays a crucial role in guiding the student. The mentor is ready to support the student at any time when necessary. In the second phase of the feedback loop, the mentor actively participates by awarding points in addition to those of the student. The mentor provides valuable feedback that not only clarifies the point awarded, but also serves as informative guidance. This approach ensures effective communication between mentor and student, which contributes to a constructive learning environment during the internship period.",

  "coach_text": "In the role of coach, one fulfills a crucial function by guiding and evaluating the student during the internship. The coach takes a leading role in the fourth phase, where a final result is awarded to the student.

Through this integrated evaluation, the coach contributes to a holistic understanding of the student's performance and development, resulting in a valuable end result. The coaching function is essential to guide and motivate the student in a targeted manner throughout the entire learning process.",
